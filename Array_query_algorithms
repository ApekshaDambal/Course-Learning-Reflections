## 5. The Need for Array Query Algorithms
Array query algorithms help retrieve and update data quickly.
For example, prefix sums can calculate the total of a range in an array very fast.
Segment trees and Fenwick trees are advanced tools that allow for both updates and queries efficiently.
These algorithms are used in applications like tracking scores, stock prices, or rainfall over time.

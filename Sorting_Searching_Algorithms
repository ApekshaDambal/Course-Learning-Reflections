## 7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms in Real-World Contexts
Sorting and searching algorithms are essential for managing and retrieving data efficiently. 
Sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and quick sort, organize data in a specified order, which is vital for applications like e-commerce and data analysis. 
Merge sort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, while quick sort selects a pivot to partition and sort the data.
Searching algorithms, such as binary search, allow for quick retrieval of items from sorted lists by halving the search space repeatedly. 
This makes them ideal for applications like finding records in databases or locating files.
Efficient sorting and searching enhance user experiences and optimize performance in various technology solutions. 
Overall, these algorithms play a crucial role in data management across different industries.

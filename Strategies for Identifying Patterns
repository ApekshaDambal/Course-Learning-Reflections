## Strategies for Identifying Patterns
Divide and Conquer: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems, solving each one to identify patterns in the overall structure.
Data Structure Selection: Choose appropriate data structures (like trees or graphs) that naturally reflect the relationships in the data, aiding in pattern recognition during analysis.
Algorithm Complexity Analysis: Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms to understand their efficiency, which can highlight patterns in performance across different inputs.
Testing and Iteration: Conduct tests with varied input cases and iterate on design choices, observing how changes impact performance and revealing underlying patterns in behavior.

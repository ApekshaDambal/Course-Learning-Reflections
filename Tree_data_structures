## 4. The Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures
Tree structures are useful for organizing and solving problems efficiently.
Binary search trees (BSTs) are good for fast searching and sorting.
Self-balancing trees like AVL trees or red-black trees ensure operations remain quick even as the tree grows.
Tries are special trees for working with words, such as in auto-complete suggestions.
Heaps are trees used to manage priorities, such as finding the largest or smallest item quickly.
These structures are essential for handling complex tasks in an organized way.

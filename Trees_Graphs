## 6. Differentiation Between Trees and Graphs
Trees and graphs represent data differently and are used for distinct purposes.
Trees are hierarchical with a single root and no cycles, like family trees or file systems.
Graphs, on the other hand, are more general, allowing multiple connections and cycles, such as in social networks or transportation systems.
Trees have specific traversals like preorder, inorder, and postorder for structured data exploration, while graphs use BFS and DFS for navigating interconnected data.
